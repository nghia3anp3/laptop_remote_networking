# hi there
This my project about connect 2 laptops in one network IP so that they can interact with each other, such as shutdown, take screenshot or sthing else...

# It based on the connection of the networking layers, using "Socket" to transfer the data.
# I'm currently using Java to do it, using the Netbeans IDE.
